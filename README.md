# LOL-Auto-Dodger-tool
A tool for League of Legends that allows you to manage a list of summoners names, in order to avoid finding "toxic" players more than once!

- Q & A:

Q: Why was this tool made?
A: This tool was made in order to help you avoiding "toxic" player not more than once, no more griefers in your games!

Q: How do I use the tool?
A: It's pretty simple. First you have to add (or remove, in case you changed idea) the players that ruined your game via the "+" button.
Then during the champ-select you can copy-paste the League chat into the "Input" text box and press "CHECK SUMMONERS" in order to, well, check the summoners ;)
Careful! It is important that you select your (IN-GAME) language in the options, otherwise the program will not be able to detect the names when you paste them from the League chat (you can still manually write them if you want).

Q: What is the Auto-Dodge feature?
A: It will help you save time during your champ-select, automatically closing your League Client after finding at least one player you added before (after you pressed the "CHECK SUMMONERS" button). By default this feature is turned off, but you can turn it on inside the options.

Q: Help! I installed a new version of the tool, but my list is empty. How do I get the old list back?
A: You can export your list in the "Options", and then you can import it back by pressing the "Import" button!

Q: Is the tool free?
A: Yes! It is completely free-to-use. Though, I would appreciate a donation if you want to support me!
